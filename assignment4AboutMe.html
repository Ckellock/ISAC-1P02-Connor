                  <p class = "aboutMeText"> About me:
My name is Connor Kellock and I am a first-year Interactive Arts and Science student at Brock University. <br/>
Some interests of mine include: Collecting vinyl records, playing rugby, listening to music, watching movies, and much more. <br/><a> <img class = "zeppelin2" src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/20/Led_Zeppelin_-_Led_Zeppelin_II.jpg" alt = "led zeppelin 2"/> </a>
I am well versed in poetry, and I also enjoy creating small instrumental songs that you can listen to on my “Portfolio” page. <br/>
Some of my favourite artists and bands include the likes of, Led Zeppelin, Tyler the Creator, Deadmau5, Motley Crue, Frank Ocean, Mac Miller, Tame Impala, and the list goes on. <br/>
I am also very passionate about computers, and computer programming, as I would like to one day incorporate it into my dream job as a Video Game Designer at Blizzard Entertainment. <br/>
I built my first computer in grade six, and I have been tinkering around with computer parts and software ever since then, and that hobby eventually leads me to where I am today: at Brock University. <br/> <a> <img class = "brockLogo" src = "http://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000201315455-syhect-original.jpg" alt = "Brock Logo"/> </a>
Being the nephew of a respected member of the early E-sports scene in the 2000s, I have always been surrounded by video games and computers. My uncle ran “Nekstlevel Interactive,” a very popular LAN gaming center in the GTA/Mississauga area, which quickly landed him a role in the birth of the E-sports scene we have today. <br/>
He has been helping me along the way to form what has turn into a full passion for video games and computers, which I (hopefully) will make my profession after I graduate. <br/>
Although I am not participating in the Brock rugby team, I was recruited to play on it two years previous, but I have chosen to become a full-time student instead of a full-time rugby player. I have earned multiple awards over the years for leadership, athleticism, and was also captain of my team throughout high school. <br/>
When I am not working, doing school work, or playing rugby, I like to unwind by watching some of my favourite movies such as The Big Lebowski, Pulp Fiction, Star Wars, and Big Trouble In Little China. Being the son of a film student, I have been brought up to know a good movie from a bad one; and if you can name a movie, I have probably seen it. <br/>
I am also a fan of all things from the 1980s, as the aesthetic and media that were produced during the decade are among some of my favourites. Movies like Escape from New York, music groups such as Duran Duran and New Order, and the colourful clothing are to name a few of the aspects that I admire about the 80s. If I had a choice, I’d time travel back to the 1980s to live my life. <br/> <a> <img class = "escapeNewYork" src ="http://www.movienewsletters.net/photos/013529R1.jpg" alt = "Escape From New York"/> </a>
One day I hope to travel the world, as it was not a luxury that my family has ever had. I have family in London, Scotland, Germany, and Italy, however my family in Canada rarely ever visits them. My parents regret never moving out of Mississauga, Ontario, as they were both raised there and still live there. I would like to one day work overseas, either in Tokyo, Poland, or London. <br/>
Thank you for reading, and I hope that you learned a little more about who I am in the process.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, as always, <br/>
Connor Kellock
