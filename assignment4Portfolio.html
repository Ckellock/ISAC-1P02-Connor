    During the extent of the course IASC 1P02, it is very evident of how my programming and design skills have evolved. <br/>

                      Below, there is a example of music that I have created over the span of a couple years. it is a quick song that I created in some spare time here at Brock. I have been making 'beats' on my computer for several years now, and if you'd like you can check out my <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/killstreakfool"> Soundcloud </a>

                    During this year at Brock, I had to create a satrical ad for another one of my classes. It is called "Gamer Gas," and it is quite funny. You can check it out below:

                   As I mentioned in the "About Me" section, I also like to write poetry. During my senior year of highschool, I took a course titled "Writers Craft," where I learned how to write poetry in several forms. Below is a sample of a free verse poem that I created for an assignment.
                 </p>
                 <p class = "poem">
                   Every groove, every spin, every listen, <br/>
They never change, don’t they?<br/>
Every stream, every download, every purchase,<br/>
They all convey feelings.<br/>
Music is what makes me.<br/>
What makes me move, <br/>
What makes me love,<br/>
What makes me dance.<br/>
What makes me breathe.<br/>
If one does not have music in their life, then why be living at all?<br/><br/>

You don’t need drugs to get there,<br/>
They’re hiding in plain sight.<br/>
Hundreds of thousands of stories that you can have <br/>
Here, right now, or<br/>
Tonight.<br/>
You don’t need a compass to find what you're looking for,<br/>
All you need is time.<br/>
Some music you won’t like, some you will, and that’s fine.<br/>
What is your prescription? What really makes you go?<br/>
What will get your body shaking, right to the dancefloor?<br/>
But of course, you don’t need to dance, no, not all the time.<br/>
Sometimes its just nice to sit and relax, headphones on,<br/>
Or in the car, speakers blaring,<br/>
even earbuds in;<br/>
I’m fine.<br/>

  These were just some of the examples of the work that I have done this year, and some things I like to do in my sparetime. <br/>
  I can ensure you that there are many other things that I could include on this page, however they are hard to format into the page. <br/>
  Some of those things include: Dungeons and Dragons campaigns, video game ideas, sketches, rough drafts, etc. It would be very hard to format some of those into this website, so I apologize.
