                On the "About me" page you can read up on some information about me, what I like, what I'm into, and any other fun facts that I choose to include about myself. <br/>
                On the "Portfolio" page, you can see some of the recent projects I have completed this school year, as well as other fun pieces of media that I have created in my own time. <br/>
                I hope that you enjoy the website, and feel free to check out my profiles that are on the other pages, as they can give you more insight into my creative endeavors.

                  <p class = "thankYou">This website will mainly be used for evaluation for my final assignment in IASC 1P02, a class that has taught me the fundementals of HTML, CSS, and Javacript. <br/>
                  I am extremely grateful of the amount of information I was taught, and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the people who run the course. <br/>
                  Huge thank you to Mike Brousseau, the intructor of the course. You were enthusiastic, helpful, and very informal in the way you taught the course. I had no previous HTML, CSS or JS knowledge going into it, however, you made it very easy for me to pick it up, and mess around with. <br/>
                Another thank you to the two lab TA's, Will and Tynan. You two helped everyone in the course understand the content, answer any and all questions, and also make the labs fun and enjoyable to attend. Without your guy's help everyone in the course would have no clue what to do. <br/>
              I hope you guys enjoy what I have created, and have a have an awesome rest of the year. <br/> <br/>
            Cheers! <br/>
          Connor Kellock
